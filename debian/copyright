These files are under the GPL - except:
	apps/jinclude.h: * Copyright (C) 1991-1994, Thomas G. Lane.
	apps/jpegint.h: * Copyright (C) 1991-1997, Thomas G. Lane.
	apps/transupp.c: * Copyright (C) 1997, Thomas G. Lane.
	apps/transupp.h: * Copyright (C) 1997, Thomas G. Lane.
	All files says:
	 * This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
	 * For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
	but README file isn't around. Luckily it can be located in the libjpeg6b sources, 
	where these files are lifted from. (This is fixed in upstream svn)
	The license-relevant part of the much bigger README file:

	In plain English:

  	   1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
	      please let us know!)
	   2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
	   3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
	      program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
              you've used the IJG code.

        In legalese:

	 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
	 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
	 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
	 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

	 This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
	 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

	 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
	 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
	 conditions:
	 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
	 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
	 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
	 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
	 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
	 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
	 the Independent JPEG Group".
	 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
	 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
	 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

	 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
	 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
	 acknowledge us.

	 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
	 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
	 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
	 software".

	 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
	 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
